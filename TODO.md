## Bugs/Problems
- There is currently an error that happens when starting the program now. Not entirely sure what is causing it besides a integer missing somewhere?

## Priority Tasks
- Implement characters (done)
- Implement enemies/npcs (decided to make the enemies other players for an easier program to make.)
- Add in gameplay elements/objectives

## Secondary Tasks
- Add screen transitions to next room/area (Not enough time to do)

## Optional Tasks
- Make special effects for attacks
- Implement tiles/textures to make the game feel more vibrant
